# THE LAST PURIFIER v0.5
The main objective of the game is to start the run from the HUB and complete all rooms to get to the empty room (boss room), with the left door you can finish the run.
Use spells and attacks to finish enemies lives, and complete all the rooms. Try not to die, or else you will get teleported again to the HUB to start a new run.

Doors close when entering rooms and open when all enemies are dead.
